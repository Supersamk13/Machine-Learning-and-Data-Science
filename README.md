# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science

Welcome to my portfolio of machine learning and data science projects. Here's a detailed overview:

## Double Dueling DQL CartPole with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)
Solve the CartPole-v1 reinforcement learning environment, where the goal is to balance a pole upright on a cart moving along a frictionless track. This project implements a custom Dueling Double Deep Q-Learning (DQL) model integrated with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER), showcasing advanced techniques for balancing exploration and exploitation in dynamic environments.
